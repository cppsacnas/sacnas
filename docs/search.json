    "text": "Meet the First CPP SACNAS Chapter E-board!\n\nPresident and Co-Founder\nJordyn Scott\nMajor: Environmental Biology\nMinor: Chemistry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am excited to offer a space where both culture and academic aspirations can be celebrated amongst CPP STEM students! As someone who has not felt seen and heard in STEM classes and discussions, I hope to help others build the belief that they can succeed in their field and affirm that they belong there. With community-based workshops, socials, and volunteering opportunities, I want other students to find dependable support and resources within CPP SACNAS that will prepare them for the next step in their vocational journey. And above all, I am grateful to be a part of an amazing team working to uplift our peers and perpetuate this mission to diversify the STEM field!\n\n\n\n\nVice President\nMatthew Luna (he/him)\nMajor: Physics\nMinor: Mathematics\nFor me I want to help in building up a SACNAS community in any way that I can. Through the E-board, my goal is to provide an inclusive community and a valuable resource for SACNAS students to achieve their goals in STEM.\n\n\nTreasurer and Co-Founder\nXimena Corona (she/her)\nBiology Graduate Student (Biomedical/Immunology)\nAs someone who cannot vote, and who’s voice is often overlooked, I find myself feeling helpless when trying to bring about change. Establishing a SACNAS chapter and serving on the E-board is a way for me to contribute to my community and help students who like me, have big dreams and goals, but don’t know what steps they need to take to get there. I want to help students even the playing ground for themselves, and the only way to do so is with the proper tools!\n\n\nCo-Director of Event Programming\nJasmyne Reyes-Estrada (she/her)\nMajor: Chemistry\nMinor: Mathematics\nBeing on the E-Board means that I get to uplift Chicano and Native American voices and build a diverse community on campus where students feel supported and encouraged to pursue their journey in science!\n\n\nCo-Director of Event Programming\nVanessa Galindo (she/her)\nMajor: Biology (Zoology Emphasis)\nWhat being on the SACNAS E-Board means to me is that I can help build a community on campus of people who are often underrepresented in the field of STEM and to help them show the world que si se puede.\n\n\nDirector of Public Relations\nLisset Hernandez (she/they)\nMajor: Biology (Zoology Emphasis)\n\n\nSecretary\nChristian Suarez (he/him)\nMajor: Biology\nBeing a promoter of equity and inclusion for STEM, a field where diversity is a necessity\n\n\nScience Council Representative\nEsbai Rabadan (she/her)\nMajor: Biology\nI am extremely grateful for this opportunity to help lead this new chapter at Cal Poly Pomona! As a first-generation college student with Mexican immigrant parents, I have witnessed firsthand the lack of help when it comes to finding support and information about STEM in my community. With the goal of achieving diversity in this field, I want to serve as support to help bridge the gap of access to resources and opportunities for underrepresented Chicano, Hispanic, and Native American students in STEM. I hope to contribute to creating a future where diversity is not just celebrated but is an integral part of the STEM workforce. I look forward to serving as the Science Council Representative for SACNAS!"
